# Numerical-Method-Visualization
Originally for a class in my Computer Science course.
Root finding algorithm from a function by numerical methods visualization.

There are several fixes to be made in the code:
  1. It can't evaluate e^x function
  2. Some plotting can fail because division by zero error
  3. Performance issue
  4. Add more methods to visualize
  
Feel free to contribute!
